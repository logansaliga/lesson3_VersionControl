            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files so that you can recall specific versions later.  What makes it especially cool is that you can use it with normal files, not just for coding/programming purposes.  Local version control systems were first created to stray away from the common method of copying files into another directory.  Local VCSs have a simple database that keeps all the changes to files under revision control.  However, people still had issues when it came to collaborating with other developers.  Centralized VCSs were developed to deal with this, and are characterized by a single server that contains all the versioned files.  These give administrators more control over those participating, and there is a lot more awareness of who is doing what in the project.  Distributed VCSs were developed when the downsides of a centralized server were revealed.  If a centralized server goes down for even an hour, no one is able to work on the project during that time.  If the database is corrupt, you can lose close to everything.  In the case of Distributed VCSs, the files fully mirror the repository.  That means that if any server dies, any one of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are four basic facts when it comes to Git.  Git thinks about data like a stream of snapshots.  This means that everytime you save, it takes a picture and stores a reference to that snapshot.  Second, nearly every operation is local.  This is great because you can work almost anywhere!  Since you don't have to retrieve versions from the server, there is little that you can't do online.  Git also has integrity.  Everything is check-summed, so it is close to impossible to lose information after it has been committed.  It is also much more protected from corruption.  The mechanism used for checksumming is called SHA-1 hash.  Finally, git generally only adds data.  This means that almost nothing is undoable or losable.  It is also nice because it gives us room to explore and experiment without worrying that the code will no longer work.  You can always revert back to a more recent version. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Sections of a Project</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main sections of a Git project:  the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area.  The directory is the most important of Git, because it is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.  When you clone a repository from another computer, this is the part of Git that is copied.  The working directory is referred to as a single checkout of one version of the project.  The files are pulled from the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on the disk for you to either use or modify.  The staging area is the middleman between the working directory and the Git directory.  It is a file that stores information about what will go into the next commit, and is often referred to as the index.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is a remote repository and a local repository.  The local repository is the repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user (like a laptop or personal desktop).  There are two ways to create a local repository.  You can either create a brand new one, or clone an existing remote repository onto a local machine.  The remote repository is one that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members.  In the case of our class, the local repository would be cloud9 and the remote repository would be GitHub.  We transfer files back and forth between the repositories with the commands add, push, pull, and commit.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Status of files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states that your files can reside in.  These are committed, modified, and staged.  When something is committed, it means that the data is safely stored in your local database, and will stay there until your direction.  Modified means that you have changed the file in some way but have not yet committed it to your database.  When a file is staged, it means that you have marked a modified file in its current version for it to go into your next commit snapshot.  Knowing these is super important when it comes to making sure your work is saved on a remote repository.</p>
